<div class="about1">Electoral Literacy Club</div>
    <div class="about2">What are ELCs?</div>
    <p class="about3">The Electoral Literacy Club (ELC) is a dynamic platform created by the Election Commission of India (ECI) with the aim of empowering and engaging students in schools, colleges, and rural communities. Its primary goal is to familiarize young individuals with their electoral rights and responsibilities, as well as the electoral process of registration and voting.

        ELCs serve as hubs where learning intersects with enjoyment. They utilize various activities and games that are designed to be engaging and thought-provoking, encouraging students to think critically and ask questions about the electoral process. These activities are carefully crafted to stimulate interest and motivation among students, making the learning experience both enjoyable and educational.
        
        The ELC initiative is not limited to schools; it extends its reach to colleges and rural communities as well. This inclusive approach ensures that individuals from diverse backgrounds and age groups are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to actively participate in the electoral process.
        
        By fostering a culture of electoral participation among young and future voters, the ELC initiative plays a crucial role in strengthening democracy. It empowers individuals to exercise their democratic rights in a responsible and informed manner, thereby contributing to the overall health and vitality of the electoral system.
